  Philosophy
  ==========
  * frontend - all bootstrap
  * backend -
    * lots of cool files
    * routing
    * some javascript
    * little node


  Struggles
  =========
  Everything came together very nicely, excepth the matching algorithm.  I couldn't get it to come together.

  I know I need to do a `for` loop inside a `for` loop.  The first `for` loop loops the `friendData` object in the friends.js file.  The second `for` runs through the scores array inside the `friendData` object.  

  Now I messed with this for sometime, but I couldn't wrap my head around it and get it to work.  

  I think what needs to happen, but didn't have time to mess with it is: 

  1. use a map function, like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24094466/javascript-sum-two-arrays-in-single-iteration
  2. once I have an array of the differences, sum that array
  3. then push those sums into their own array
  4. select the lowest sum from that array as the best match

  Ideas for Improvement
  =====================
  Style it up a little.  And figure out the matching algorithm of course

  Styling
  =======
  pretty basic bootstrap right now
